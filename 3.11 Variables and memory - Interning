#interning is a method used by python interpreter for optimization and to lessen memory usage 

a= 10
b =10
print(a is b) #True
c = 300
d =300
print(c is d)#False

'''
a and b share same memory location. But c and d does not. WHy?
This is because of interning.
WHat is Interning? -- At startup python pre-loads a gloal list of integers in the range [-5,256]
the interned objects are called singletons

'''
a = 10
b =int(10)
c = int('10')
d = int('1010',base=2)
print(a,b,c,d)# 10 10 10 10
print((a is b) is(c is d)) #True
