'''
Generally objects get destroyed when we don not ahve any reference pouinting at em. But sometimes this does not happen. But why? because of circular reference.
myvar -> obj a (var1) -> obj b (var2) ->obj a

if we destroy the reference myvar, obj a will be referencing obj b and obj will be referencing obj a. In this case the reference counting does not help. We have to use garbage collection and this phenomenon is known as Memory leak

Python 3.4 and > are having GC which are capable of detecting and fixing memory leaks.
